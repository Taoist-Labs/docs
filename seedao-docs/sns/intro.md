## Overview

SeeDAO Name Service (SNS) is a decentralized name service based on blockchain. It is a smart contract that maps human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses and so on.

We use SNS to identify users in the SeeDAO community, making community communication smoother and user experience better. SNS is also associated with SeePASS to show the various achievements of community members.

Top-level domain of SNS is `.seedao`, for example, `baiyu.seedao`.
