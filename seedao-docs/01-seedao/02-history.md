# History of SeeDAO

## Whoâ€™s running SeeDAO? Is there a company behind it?

There is no company leading the operation of SeeDAO.

Historically, SeeDAO was incubated and operated by a company named CryptoC, but the founder of CryptoC dismissed the company in May 2022 and transferred the whole financing funds into SeeDAOâ€™s treasury.

Now, SeeDAO operates autonomously based on its Meta Protocol, according to which contributors govern the community.
